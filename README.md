<h1>Recipe Website Project</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This project is focused on building a simple recipe website using HTML. The website will feature a main index page with links to several recipe pages. The goal is to practice and demonstrate basic HTML concepts, including creating web pages, linking between them, structuring content with different HTML elements, and organizing files effectively.</p>

<h2>Skills Demonstrated</h2>
Once the project is complete, the following skills will have been demonstrated:

<h3>1. HTML Structure:</h3>

- Creating a basic HTML5 document structure (using \<html>, \<head>, \<body>, etc.)

- Organizing content using semantic tags such as \<header>, \<footer>, \<article>, \<section>, and \<nav>.

<h3>2. Hyperlinks and Navigation:</h3>

- Using \<a> tags to create links between pages, making the website navigable.

<h3>3. Lists and Tables:</h3>

- Displaying information with ordered and unordered lists (\<ul>, \<ol>, \<li>), as well as tables (\<table>, \<th>, \<tr>, \<td>).

<h3>4. Images:</h3>

- Embedding images to enhance the content using the \<img> tag.

<h3>5. File Organization:</h3>

- Structuring the project with proper file and folder organization, such as separating HTML files, assets (images), and other content in relevant directories.

<h3>6. Project Outline</h3>

- Home Page (index.html):

- The homepage will include a navigation bar with links to different recipe pages.

- Recipe Pages (recipe1.html, recipe2.html, etc.):

- Each recipe page will have a title, ingredients list, and instructions on how to prepare the dish.

<h1>Final Thoughts</h1>
<p>This project has been a great opportunity to practice foundational HTML skills and understand the structure and functionality of a basic website. By creating a simple recipe website, I was able to dive into the essentials of organizing content, creating links, and structuring information clearly and logically. Here are some key takeaways from this project:</p>

<h2>Key Learnings:</h2>
<p>1. <strong>HTML Fundamentals</strong>: I gained a deeper understanding of the basic structure of an HTML document, including how to use tags effectively, organize content using semantic elements, and build a simple, navigable website.</p>

<p>2. <strong>Linking and Navigation</strong>: Creating links between pages was an important skill to practice. I now feel more confident in using <\a> tags and understanding how navigation works on a website.</p>

<p><strong>Content Organization</strong>: I practiced organizing content with lists, tables, images, and headings to make the information clear and easy to follow, especially on the recipe pages.</p>

<p><strong>File Organization</strong>: This project helped me improve my ability to organize files, making sure my HTML files and assets (like images) are structured neatly in folders. I now have a better understanding of how to keep a project organized for easy maintenance.</p>

<h2>Challenges:</h2>
<p>1. <strong>Staying Organized</strong>: The biggest challenge was making sure that everything was correctly linked and that the file structure remained simple and clean. Ensuring that all the pages linked properly without errors took some trial and error.</p>

<p>2. <strong>HTML Syntax</strong>: While HTML is straightforward, remembering to properly close tags and ensuring there were no missing elements took a bit of attention to detail.</p>

<h2>What’s Next:</h2>
<p>The next step for this project will be to enhance its look and feel using CSS. Adding styles will bring the website to life, making it more visually appealing and user-friendly. Later, I’ll also consider adding more advanced features, like forms for feedback or a search function for the recipes.</p>

<p>Overall, I feel confident in my basic HTML skills and look forward to improving the website further with additional features and design elements in future iterations.</p>
