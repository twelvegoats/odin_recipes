            <li>3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>¼ cup lemon juice</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon water (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>To make the crust: Combine graham cracker crumbs, butter, sugar, and cinnamon in a bowl; mix well. Press onto the bottom of an ungreased 9-inch springform pan. Place in the refrigerator to chill for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).</li>
        <li>To make the filling: Place strawberries and cornstarch into a blender; cover and puree until smooth.</li>
        <li>Pour strawberry sauce into a saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Boil and stir until sauce is thick and shiny, about 2 minutes. Set aside 1/3 cup strawberry sauce; cool. Cover and refrigerate remaining sauce for serving.</li>
        <li>Beat cream cheese in a mixing bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy; gradually beat in condensed milk. Mix in lemon juice and vanilla extract, then beat in eggs on low speed until just combined.</li>
        <li>Pour 1/2 of the cream cheese mixture over crust; drop 1/2 of the reserved strawberry sauce by 1/2 teaspoonfuls on cream cheese layer.</li>
        <li>Carefully spoon remaining cream cheese mixture over sauce; drop remaining strawberry sauce by 1/2 teaspoonfuls on top.</li>
        <li>Cut through the top layer only with a knife to swirl strawberry sauce.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the center is almost set, 45 to 50 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Carefully run a knife around the edge of the pan to loosen; cool for 1 hour at room temperature. Refrigerate at least 4 hours to overnight before serving.</li>
        <li>Serve reserved strawberry sauce with cheesecake. If sauce is too thick, stir in water.</li>
